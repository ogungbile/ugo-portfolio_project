### NOTE 6-14-2023

This project helps to customize a Mikrotik routerboard control panel(or winbox) for users to be able to make basic changes to their router like changing the router password or SSID. We want to focus on basic changes that can be effected by a non technical user like changing the WiFi password of the router, changing the SSID, viewing the number of devices actively connected to the WiFi and viewing current traffic to ascertain if subscribed bandwidth is saturated or not.

Please note that this app is [deployed](https://ogungbile.pythonanywhere.com/login)

## Description :bulb:

Ior ISPs that make use of universal routers like cisco, mikrotik, to mention but a few, it is necessary that client's own control panel be designed to present limited view to what changes they can effect in order to prevent them tampering with other configuration that may be service impacting.
